## üìú History
 - Origin:  
	Project created by [N-z0](https://github.com/N-z0) a long time ago. (In the 90s)
	
	I started this project around my 15 years old ,maybe one of my oldest.  
	So.. yeah,,,  it makes laugh to see that, because it's over ambitious .  
	But  compared to the today's kids,  i dont feel any shame... üòÅ
	
	I remember making plans and model with cardboards at my father's place.  
	And made a paw with metal parts bought in DIY stores,  
	Also realized a first very complete paw model on Autocad software, but lost unfortunately.
	
 - Development:  
	I recently (2019) wanted to edit this project,
	for also improve my objects design management.
